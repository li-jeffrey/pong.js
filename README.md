# pong.js
pong on canvas, on ES6

## Development
While all files are static, the scripts use ES6 import/exports which are blocked by CORS restrictions on the `file` protocol. The easiest way to launch the game is to have npm installed, then run the following in the workspace folder:
```
npx serve
```
